    <h5>Methods</h5>
    <br>
    <p>To create this map I used the buffer and intersect methods. Once I had found a polygon of the recorded wildfires in 
        California i had to create a 10 mile buffer aroud it. I did this by creating a new .geojson of the polygon in the 3857
        projection and then using the buffer tool on that new polygon. Once I had my new buffer polygon I added a vector of 
        the schools in California and also put tnat is 3857. I then used the intersect tool to get just the schools that fell within
        the wildfire buffer.
