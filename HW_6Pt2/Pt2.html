 <h3>Equal Interval Map</h3>
 <p>Pros: It is easy to understand and apply, and it is useful when the data are evenly distributed across the range of values. It also ensures that each class has the same range of values.
    Cons: It can create misleading results if the data are not evenly distributed, and it may not produce meaningful categories if the data has extreme values.</p>

<h3>Equal Count Map</h3>
<p>Pros: It ensures that each category has an equal number of observations, which can help to highlight patterns in the data. It also produces meaningful categories for data that are not evenly distributed.
    Cons: It can create categories that do not make sense, such as categories with a wide range of values, and it may not work well for data with extreme values.</p>

<h3>Natural Breaks Map</h3>
<p>Pros: It uses statistical algorithms to group similar values together, which can result in more meaningful and intuitive categories. It also works well for data that are not evenly distributed.
    Cons: It may produce categories that are not evenly distributed or do not make sense. It can also be sensitive to outliers.</p>
